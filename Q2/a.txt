You can write and execute R commands in several ways, depending on your preferred environment. Here are some common methods:

1. **R Console:**
   The simplest way to interact with R is through its console, which provides a command-line interface. You can type R commands directly into the console and press Enter to execute them. The results are displayed immediately.

2. **R Script:**
   You can write a sequence of R commands in a text file with a ".R" extension (e.g., "myscript.R"). Use a text editor to create the file and then run it from the R console using the `source()` function.

   Example script ("myscript.R"):
   ```r
   x <- 5
   y <- 10
   sum <- x + y
   print(sum)
   ```

   To run the script in R console:
   ```r
   source("myscript.R")
   ```

3. **R Markdown:**
   R Markdown documents combine R code with text, allowing you to create reports, presentations, and documents with executable code chunks. You can render R Markdown files into various formats, including HTML, PDF, and Word.

4. **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):**
   IDEs like RStudio provide a more user-friendly environment for writing and executing R commands. You can write scripts, run individual lines of code, and manage your projects more efficiently. RStudio also offers features like code autocompletion, debugging, and integrated plotting.

5. **Notebooks:**
   Similar to R Markdown, R notebooks (available in RStudio and Jupyter notebooks with an R kernel) allow you to combine code, visualizations, and narrative text in a single document. You can run code chunks and see the output directly below them.

6. **Command-Line Scripts:**
   You can create standalone R scripts that are meant to be executed from the command line or as part of automated processes. You execute these scripts by running `Rscript` followed by the script's filename.

Remember that in all these methods, you use the R programming language syntax to write your commands, and you execute them by pressing Enter (in the console), running the script, or using the appropriate execution command.

Here's a simple example of writing and executing R commands in the R console:

```r
# Calculate the sum of two numbers
x <- 5
y <- 10
sum <- x + y
print(sum)
```

When you press Enter after typing each line in the R console, you'll see the output immediately.
