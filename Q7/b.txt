Certainly! Here are the R commands to perform a one-sample t-test and a two-sample t-test:

**One-Sample T-Test:**

```r
# Example data
data <- c(23, 28, 32, 25, 30, 27, 29, 31, 26, 24)

# Perform a one-sample t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(data, mu = 30)  # Testing against a population mean of 30

# Print the t-test result
print(t_test_result)
```

In this example, `data` is your sample data, and you're testing whether the sample mean is significantly different from a specified population mean (in this case, 30).

**Two-Sample T-Test:**

```r
# Example data for two samples
group1 <- c(23, 28, 32, 25, 30)
group2 <- c(27, 29, 31, 26, 24)

# Perform a two-sample t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(group1, group2)

# Print the t-test result
print(t_test_result)
```

In this example, `group1` and `group2` are two sets of data that you're comparing. The `t.test()` function performs a two-sample t-test to test whether the means of the two groups are significantly different.

The printed t-test results will include information about the test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, confidence intervals, and more.

Remember to replace the example data with your actual data when using these commands.
