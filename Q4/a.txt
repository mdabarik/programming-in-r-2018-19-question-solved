In R, you can create a matrix using the `matrix()` function. Here's how you can create a 3x4 matrix with the numbers 1 to 12:

```r
# Create a 3x4 matrix with numbers 1 to 12
matrix_3x4 <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```

In this example, the `matrix()` function takes the sequence of numbers `1:12`, specifies the number of rows (`nrow = 3`) and columns (`ncol = 4`), and sets the `byrow` parameter to `TRUE` to fill the matrix by rows.

Now, let's perform the requested operations:

**i) Element in 2nd row and 3rd column:**
```r
element_2_3 <- matrix_3x4[2, 3]
```

**ii) Element in 3rd row and 4th column:**
```r
element_3_4 <- matrix_3x4[3, 4]
```

**iii) All elements in the 2nd column:**
```r
column_2 <- matrix_3x4[, 2]
```

**iv) All elements in the 1st row:**
```r
row_1 <- matrix_3x4[1, ]
```

In each case, the indices inside the square brackets specify the row and column you're interested in. Using an empty index on one side (e.g., `[, 2]` or `[1, ]`) indicates you want all elements along that dimension.

After executing these operations, you'll have the requested values stored in the respective variables (`element_2_3`, `element_3_4`, `column_2`, `row_1`).
