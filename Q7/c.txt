Certainly! Here's an R program that constructs the sample space for an experiment of tossing a coin a specified number of times:

```r
# Function to generate all possible outcomes for coin tosses
generate_sample_space <- function(num_tosses) {
  outcomes <- c("H", "T")  # "H" for heads, "T" for tails
  
  # Initialize the sample space with the outcomes of the first toss
  sample_space <- outcomes
  
  # Generate additional outcomes by appending each outcome to the existing sample space
  for (i in 2:num_tosses) {
    new_space <- expand.grid(sample_space, outcomes)
    sample_space <- apply(new_space, 1, paste, collapse = "")
  }
  
  return(sample_space)
}

# Specify the number of coin tosses
num_tosses <- 3

# Generate and print the sample space
sample_space <- generate_sample_space(num_tosses)
print(sample_space)
```

In this example, the `generate_sample_space()` function generates the sample space for a specified number of coin tosses. It starts by defining the outcomes ("H" for heads and "T" for tails) and then uses a loop to create new outcomes by combining the previous outcomes with the current set of outcomes.

You can change the `num_tosses` variable to any positive integer to construct the sample space for a different number of coin tosses. The `sample_space` variable will contain all possible outcomes for the experiment.
