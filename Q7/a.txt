Certainly! Here are the R commands to calculate the simple correlation coefficient and fit a simple linear regression model:

**Simple Correlation Coefficient:**

```r
# Example data
x <- c(12, 15, 20, 25, 30)
y <- c(22, 28, 35, 45, 50)

# Calculate the correlation coefficient
correlation_coefficient <- cor(x, y)
print(correlation_coefficient)
```

In this example, `x` and `y` are your two variables. The `cor()` function calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two variables.

**Simple Linear Regression Model:**

```r
# Example data
x <- c(12, 15, 20, 25, 30)
y <- c(22, 28, 35, 45, 50)

# Fit a simple linear regression model
linear_model <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(linear_model)
```

In this example, `x` is the independent variable, and `y` is the dependent variable. The `lm()` function fits a simple linear regression model. The `summary()` function provides a summary of the regression model's results, including coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and more.

Remember to replace the example data with your actual data when using these commands.
