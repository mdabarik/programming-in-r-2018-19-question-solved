To obtain random numbers from a standard normal distribution and create histograms for different sample sizes (10, 100, 1000, 10000) in a single figure in R, you can use the following code with the `hist()` function and the `par()` function to arrange the plots:

```r
# Set up the layout for the plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# Generate and plot histograms for different sample sizes
sample_sizes <- c(10, 100, 1000, 10000)

for (size in sample_sizes) {
  random_numbers <- rnorm(size)
  hist(random_numbers, main = paste("Histogram (n =", size, ")", sep = ""), xlab = "Value", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue")
}

# Reset the layout to default
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

In this code:

- `par(mfrow = c(2, 2))` sets up a 2x2 grid for arranging the plots.
- The loop generates random numbers for each sample size and creates histograms using the `hist()` function.
- `main`, `xlab`, and `ylab` parameters are used to customize the titles and labels of the histograms.
- `col` parameter sets the color of the bars in the histograms.
- After plotting, `par(mfrow = c(1, 1))` resets the layout to the default.

This code will create a single figure with four histograms, each corresponding to a different sample size. The histograms will be arranged in a 2x2 grid.
